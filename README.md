# Wombon't

A desktop recreation of the Wombo app.


## Get started
*Note that you will need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and you should see the app running.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Svelte recommends installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm start`.
